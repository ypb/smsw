Major TODOs due to discovered usage patterns and intricate gotchas (gathered
in one files for easier overview, in random order):

 * downloading needs to preserve file timestamps DONE (for wget)
 * the same package files are shared between different slackware versions
 * do not initiate ALL mirrors, but only the ones chosen in etc/main
 * as it is now changing config (specifically version looked upon)
   should also trigger package list recomputation
 * find a way to discover and perhaps record available releases on the
   given mirror (perhaps not so crucial if tracking -current only)
 * looks like we need to track package versions at the least (across releases)
 * what's with making sure directories exist? if download fails... we are left
   with empty ones ;(
 * BLACKLIST/WHITELIST on ad hoc mass downloads, or "answers" to given class of
   action, see next...
 * if we are on it, think about the logic of (update only makes sense on
   -current, except for patches)
 * organize in consumers and providers... e.g. (get-core-pkgs) can not be run
   without information from tagfiles, and you shouldn't be forced to manually:
   first, (initing-mirrors) in order to get them and then... refreshing
   internal list of packages in order to filter by them...
 * we DON'T NEED to wget files one by one? or do we? NO, we DON'T...
